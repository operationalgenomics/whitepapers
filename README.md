# Operational Genomics — White Papers

This repository contains the official White Papers that introduce and formalize
the discipline of **Operational Genomics** and the architectural foundations of
**The Digital Genome**.

These documents present the conceptual, technical and philosophical basis for a 
new class of industrial intelligence designed for **Industry 5.0** — where 
purpose, action and cognition converge.

## 🧠 What is Operational Genomics?

Operational Genomics is the discipline that treats operational knowledge as an 
**evolutive and intentional organism**, encoded through:

- Praxeological Codons  
- Operational Genes  
- Digital Genomes  
- Cognitive Cores  
- Universal Neutral Language (UNL)

Its goal is to overcome industrial fragmentation and enable coherent, explainable, 
real-time intelligent action across complex environments.
